🦠 COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
This project explores the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through data analysis and visualization. Using SQL for data manipulation and Tableau for interactive dashboards, it presents key insights into infection rates, death counts, vaccination progress, and population-level effects across countries and continents.

📌 Project Objectives
Analyze global COVID-19 trends using structured queries in SQL.
Calculate and visualize key metrics: total cases, deaths, death rate, vaccination coverage, and infection rate.
Identify countries and continents with highest infection and death counts.
Build dynamic and insightful dashboards in Tableau for public health decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL (T-SQL) — for data exploration, cleaning, and transformation
Tableau — for interactive data visualization and dashboards
Microsoft SQL Server — for querying datasets
COVID-19 Datasets — from public sources (e.g., OWID)

📊 Key Insights Derived
Death Rate Trends: Tracked % of deaths over total cases by country and globally.
Infection vs Population: Measured what % of population was infected.
Vaccination Analysis: Rolling total vaccinations by country with % of vaccinated population.
Continental Impact: Compared COVID-19 metrics across continents.
